# Allostasis

## Notes

- For allostasis model, do we want the exteroceptive prior to be on proprioception or interoception? 
- Add noise to data variables
- We are not accounting for prior - reflex arc is just cancelling change in interoceptive state estimation. Remove prior?
  - No separation of perception and preferences
- Priors in interoceptive or exteroceptive?
- Action in continious model?
- How to deal with categorical to continious - average or take maximum?
